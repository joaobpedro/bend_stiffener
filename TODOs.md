# BEND STIFFENER OPTIMIZER

  * [x] design the overall structure of the program
    * [ ] the design has been made but needs improvment
  * [x] define inputs
  * [x] run a dummy example
    * [x] calculate the strain vs length given a tension and angle
    * [x] run maximum angles for a given tension up to a given strain value
  * [ ] correct the EI calculation
  * [ ] implement optimization for a given set of load cases, minimize the strain distance.
  * [ ] implement input from the user on the bend stiffner dimensions
  * [ ] implement non-linear material properties
  * [ ] make possible for the user to should how to extract the tension/angles pairs, i.e., orcaflex post-processing
  or direct input from the user
