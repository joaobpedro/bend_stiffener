# BEND STIFFENER OPTIMIZER

  * [ ] design the overall structure of the program
  * [ ] define inputs
  * [ ] decide if the user need to provide the tension/angles or if we post-process orcaflex
  * [ ] run a dummy example
    * [ ] calculate the strain vs length given a tension and angle
    * [ ] run maximum angles for a given tension up to a given strain value
  * [ ] implement optimization for a given set of load cases, minimize the strain distance.


  * [ ] do I need a finite element simple model
  * [ ] investigate the finite element model
